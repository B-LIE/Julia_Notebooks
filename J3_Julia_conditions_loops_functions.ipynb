    "## Conditional choices\n",
    "### General if statement\n",
    "The standard `if` syntax is:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "if condition_1\n",
    "    <block_1>\n",
    "elseif condition_2\n",
    "    <block_2>\n",
    "    ...\n",

    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, a `condition_j` is a statement having a `Bool` outcome, and may be composed of Bool variables, relational expressions, logical expressions, etc. Depending on the conditions, the first condition (`condition_j`) that is `true` is chosen, `block_j` is executed, and the if-statement is finished.\n",

    "## Loops\n",
    "### For loops\n",
    "#### Basic loop\n",
    "The general syntax is\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "for c in col\n",
    "    <block>\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `col` is some collection or iterator, and `c` will in turn be given a value by traversing `col`. Alternatively to `for c in col`, the syntax `for c = col` is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in all languages, it is possible to have loops within loops. In Julia, there is a simplified syntax for this:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "for i in I, j in J, ...\n",
    "    <block>\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "which is a short form of\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "for i in I\n",
    "    for j in J\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        <block>\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    end\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enumeration\n",
    "Sometimes, both the *value* and the *index* in the collection is needed:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "for (i,c) in enumerate(col)\n",
    "    <block>\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comprehension\n",
    "Comprehension is an efficient way to create arrays without intermediate arrays. The syntax is:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "[expression for c in C]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `expression` is typically computed from `c`, and one vector element is created for each `c` in `C`. The syntax can be extended with more loops, leading to higher dimensional arrays:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "[expression for c1 in C1, c2 in C2, ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variable scope and loops\n",
    "Iterators in loops (e.g., `c` in `for c in C`) are local to the loop, and its value does not exist outside of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps more unusual is that variables defined inside a loop have local scope within the loop, and do not exist when the loops is finished. However, if a variable has been defined prior to a loop, and this variable is modified inside the loop, then the modification exists after the loop."

    "## Functions\n",
    "### General functions\n",
    "The basic syntax for defining a function in Julia is:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "function f(x)\n",
    "    statements\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `x` is the argument of the function. The statement `return result` determines what is returned from the function; typically `result` is a tuple, e.g., specified by a comma separated list of elements. If statement `return` is dropped, the last result computed in the `statements` is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any variable introduced inside of the function has *local scope*, and can not be examined outside of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can have multiple input arguments. Arguments are given *positional* reference (`args`) or are referenced by keywords. Arguments are separated by comma as in tuples. However, to make a distinction between positional arguments and keyword arguments, a semicolon is used:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "function f(arg1, arg2, ..., argn; kwarg1, krarg2,...)\n",
    "    statements\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is possible to give default values to both positional and keyword arguments, e.g.:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "function f(arg1, arg2, arg3=val1,...; kwarg1 = kwval1,...)\n",
    "    statements\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling a function, the positional arguments (those occurring before \";\") must be given in the specified order. However, keyword arguments can be given in any order. Example:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "function f(x,n=1; a=1, b=2, c=1)\n",
    "    return a*x^n + b*(1/x)^n + c*log(n+1,x)\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function can be called as `f(2)`, `f(2,3)`, `f(2;a=5)`, `f(2;c=3,a=2)`, etc. The point with keyword arguments is that they can be given in arbitrary order. Positional variables, however, *have* to be given in the specified order.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final comment: in the *definition* of functions, a semicolon must be used to separate positional arguments vs. keyword arguments. However, when *calling* a function, use of semicolon is optional: we can also just use comma when calling the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type declaration for arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to specify the type of arguments using the syntax `x::T` where `T` is some type. As an example:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "function f(x::Number, n::Int=1; a::Number=1, b::Number=2, c::Number = 1)\n",
    "    statements\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "will restrict the type of allowed arguments, and may help in avoiding erroneus use of  function. Think of the `x :: T` as in mathematics: $x \\in \\cal{T}$ where $\\cal{T}$ is a set. **However**, it is recommended to use as few restrictions as possible on the type of function arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function dispatching\n",
    "\n",
    "A key concept in Julia is that of function *dispatching*. The idea is that it is possible to define many different \"functions\" in Julia with the same name, but with different number of arguments, and with different type restrictions on arguments. These different versions of functions with the same name are referreded to as *methods*. [In many cases, dispatching is the same as function/operator overloading, but not in all cases.] Dispatching solves one problem with namespace in other languages: in, e.g., Python, if you write a new function, and accidentally give it the same name as an existing function, you simply overwrite the existing function so that it is not available any more. This is so no matter what arguments the function has, and what its results are. In Julia, on the other hand, it is possible to create functions with the same name as existing ones, without destroying the functionality of the original functions -- as long as the two functions do not have identical arguments (including: identical types).\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example of dispatching: the Julia function `range` can be used to produce an iterator of numbers, as in `range(0,2*pi,length=10)`. But if the two first arguments are *colors*, the the function produces an iterator of *colors* between the two given values; we'll see examples of this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-line functions\n",
    "Simple functions used in mathematics, etc., can be given a simplified on-line defintion with syntax:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "f(x) = statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "Such functions can also have multiple arguments, keyword arguments, etc. If the `statement` is too complicated to fit in one-line, it can be wrapped in a `begin... end` block, and stretch over multiple lines:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Such a chaining can also be written using syntax: `g∘f(x)` where `∘` is introduced as `\\circ + TAB`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, such a chaining can also be written using *function piping*, with notation `f(x) |> g`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all three ways of achievng function chaining, the requirement on return value of `f(x)` to match the required argument of `g(x)` is the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case that the returned value of `f(x)` does not match the required argument of `g(x)`, it is convenient to use anonymous functions to correct this. Such corrections may get somewhat cluttered, and to reduce the clutter, piping is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unpacking collections to sequence of arguments\n",
    "Suppose we have a collection that we need to pass to a function where the function requires multiple arguments. We can then *unpack* the collection `C` as follows: `f(C...)`."

    "## User-defined types\n",
    "Julia types are dynamic, nominative and parametric. The `::` operator can be used to attach type annotations to expressions and variables in programs. This may add extra information to the (Just-In-Time; JIT) compiler so that the compiled code runs more efficiently, but it may also help to inform the user about a wrong choice of argument in function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract types\n",
    "Abstract types are defined using the syntax `abstract type «name» end` or `abstract type «name» <: «supertype» end`. An abstract type is used as the \"main branch\" of several more specialized abstract types, or as the main branch of several concrete types. In Julia, the most general type is `Any`. One example of an abstract numeric type is `Number`; another is `Real`. This means that Julia has built-in the following abstract types:\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "abstract type Number end\n",
    "abstract type Real <: Number end\n",
    "```\n",
    "and so on. Suppose a user wants to define a new type for dynamic systems. This could be, e.g., `abstract type DynamicSystem end`. Then perhaps one wants to create concrete subtype named `LTI` for Linear, Time Invariant system. To do that, we need to discuss concrete, composite types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitive types\n",
    "The primitive types are built-in types, which are defined as, e.g., `primitive type Int16 <: Signed 16 end`, which essentially says that type `Int16` is a subtype of abstract type `Signed`, and takes up `16 bits` of memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composite types\n",
    "Composite types are denoted \"records\", \"structs\", or \"objects\" in other languages. Immutable types are defined in a `struct`... `end` block, where the block defines the data fields of the type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "struct typename\n",
    "    field specification block\n",
    "end\n",
    "``` \n",
    "The field specification block lists the field names, and optionally their type. If field names are given without type, they are assumed to be of type `Any`. The type name also works as a type *constructor*/instantiator, which is a function with the same number of arguments as there are fields.\n",

    "Julia has a built-in, simple *macro*  for measuring time consumption and memory allocation during execution: `@time`. There are better tools for doing this, but they require additional packages which we have not looked into yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The timing macro is used by prepending a statement with `@time`. If the statement goes over several lines, we can use the `@time begin ... end` construct, where the execution block is inserted instead of `...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is based on Just-In-Time compilation, which implies that the code is compiled the first time a function us executed. Thus, timing the first execution will include both the compilation time and the execution time. It is therefore not fair to report execution of the first run of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Julia is based on multiple dispatch, and may have many methods which vary depending on their arguments/argument types, this also has the consequence that if an argument type is changed, from one call to another, the new method that will then be used must also be compiled. In other words: changing the arguments/argument type requires a fresh compilation."

    "### Reduce array allocation\n",
    "It is common to introduce temporary variables in functions. Variables in functions are stored either in the so-called *stack* memory or in the so-called *heap* memory. Every time a function is called, the programming language allocates some stack memory to the function; the stack memory is relatively small, and is deleted every time the program exits the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When more memory is needed than is available in the stack, these variables are put into the *heap* memory. This typically happens for larger collections such as arrays, etc. The programming language does not automatically delete allocated heap memory, and this implies that new memory space is allocated every time the function is called. If a function is called many times, allocated memory in the heap can grow uncontrollably. This build-up of memory allocation is particular problematic in code where functions are called many times, such as in differential equation solvers, root solvers, optimization code, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programming languages, such as C, have special commands for *deleting* the allocated memory in heap. If this deletion of allocated memory is not done properly, the programs are known to have a \"memory leak\". In other languages, such as Julia, Python, MATLAB, etc., special routines for \"garbage collection\" are used to reduce the growth of allocated memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to reduce this build-up of heap memory allocation is to reduce the introduction of new variables in a function. This can be done by passing a variable as an argument in the function call, and then use this input argument to store temporary variables and results. In this way, we instead operate on an existing memory structure: no matter how many times the function is called, we are still working on the same memory addresses. The \"downside\" of this is, of course, that the variable in the function call is *changed*. "
